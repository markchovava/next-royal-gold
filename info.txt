Royal Gold Niger
is a recently established joint venture in Niger, 
formed through a partnership between the government of Niger 
and **Suvarna Royal Gold Trading LLC, a company based in Dubai.

The primary objective of Royal Gold Niger SA is to establish an integrated industrial 
complex within Niger. This complex will feature:

* **A state-of-the-art gold refinery:** This facility aims to process raw gold extracted in Niger 
domestically, rather than exporting it for refinement elsewhere. The projected capacity is to process 
up to one ton of gold per month.
* **A jewelry manufacturing unit:** This will enable the local production of gold jewelry, adding further value to the refined gold.
* **A gemstone cutting and polishing center:** This component will allow Niger to process its gemstones within the country, creating more economic benefit from these resources.

**Key Goals and Rationale:**

The formation of Royal Gold Niger SA is a cornerstone of Niger's new mining policy, which emphasizes **economic sovereignty** and maximizing the benefits of its natural resources for its citizens. The government's stated goals include:

* **Value Retention:** 
* **Job Creation:** 
* **Industrial Capacity Building:** 
* **Formalization and Revenue Enhancement:** 
* **Diversification of Alliances:** Partnering with a Dubai-based firm also signals Niger's openness 
to new global alliances, particularly with Gulf-based investors, potentially reducing reliance on
 traditional Western aid models.

**Controversies and Concerns:**

Despite the ambitious goals, the partnership has drawn significant criticism due 
to the involvement of Kamlesh Pattni, the CEO of Suvarna Royal Gold Trading LLC. Pattni 
is notorious for his central role in Kenya's **Goldenberg scandal** of the 1990s, a 
massive financial fraud involving the alleged embezzlement of billions from public 
coffers through fraudulent gold and diamond export incentives.

More recently, in December 2024, the **US and UK governments imposed sanctions on Pattni** 
for allegedly leading a global gold smuggling and money laundering network based in Zimbabwe. 
These sanctions include asset freezes, property confiscation, and travel bans. Al Jazeera's 
"Gold Mafia" investigation also implicated Pattni in extensive illicit gold trading and money 
laundering schemes.

The Nigerien government, however, has chosen to move forward with the partnership, 
presenting it as a crucial step for national economic development and sovereignty, downplaying 
the controversies surrounding Pattni. The financial terms of the deal have not been publicly 
disclosed.
